<h1 class=description-head>Song Exploder</h1>
<div class=all-desc>
<div class=description-titles>Overview</div>
<div class=description-body>
Song Exploder is a podcast where musicians are invited to dissect their songs and talk about the process of creating their tracks. I wanted to highlight this by cutting the artist talking about their work and playing the segment they talk about. I wanted to explore how I could show this visually and decided to go with line art where the artist is drawn on-screen to illustrate the build-up of their music and personality. I tried to chose audio snippets where the artist is being personal or expressive to get their personality through into the video as I believe that’s important to allow a viewer to connect.</div>
<div class=description-titles>Brief</div>
<div class=description-body>
The brief set was to explore the creation of promotional content, where there are no pictures/visual stimulus to aid us. As this is something we most probably will come across during our time as motion designers. We were asked to create a 30 second promotional film where it illustrates what the podcast is about and brings the audiences attention to watch more.</div>
<div class=description-titles>Process</div>
<div class=description-body>
I wanted to explore how I could express the artists personality as I felt it would be the best way to connect with the audience. I chose to find audio snippets within the podcasts that showed the artist being expressive or saying something interesting that was personal to them. I then linked the audio with the stub they were talking about provided by Song Exploder. This allowed me to create a clear narrative path (Artist>Audio Stub> Audio Track). I believe creating a clear workflow is important when creating a series of videos as it makes it easier to incorporate different ideas whilst also making the video much more recognisable to an audience. Visually I started this project by creating simple patterns for the background, I ended up going with the grid pattern which relates to the logo which is built up with squares. I wanted to show the amount of artists that had been on previously so I had this appear on screen during the song playing, it skips through the previous 30 people to the artist featured.</div>
