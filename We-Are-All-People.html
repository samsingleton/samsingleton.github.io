<div class=description-titles>Overview</div>
<div class=description-body>
We Are All People is an imaginary charity with an aim to help bring awareness to refugees. It thrives to remove stigmas and challenge people to realise we are all humans. I wanted to explore how I could spark the connection in a more thought provoking way. I decided to highlight the fact that we are all the same. By doing so I created 5 12~ second promotional video that show an average statistic across all people with an end-slate to tie all the videos together making it a cohesive campaign.</div>
<div class=description-titles>Brief</div>
<div class=description-body>
For this brief I was asked to create a campaign to raise awareness for an important social issue. I was given basic information about the given topic and was asked to research further to gain a better understanding. The deliverable for this unit was to create a 1 minute promotional video that raises awareness, this means it should be aimed at a broad audience. We can produce this video how we like however it must be information led and relevant to the subject and audience. This is focused more on the idea generation than the final piece however we are still to deliver a clear idea of how this ties in with the rest of the campaign.

<div class=description-titles>Process</div>
<div class=description-body>
I started the process of this piece by researching further into the refugee crisis and found multiple articles expressing the fact that some dehumanise refugee’s. I decided to explore how I could re-humanize these people to an audience once more. I started to look into average statistics about the entire population where I found quite a few interesting ones which I thought were attention grabbing. After doing so I began creating the end-slate for the pieces. I knew I wanted the tag-line ‘we are all people’. So I began exploring how I could animate the type, I found using single weighted strokes to create type was a good way to bring in the type. I ended up using this technique throughout creating a simple visual identity that could be used for the charity if the idea was brought forward. The last section of the pieces would be the short character animation, that would be the logo or mark for the charitable organisation, I chose to use this as it was of utmost importance to include a personal touch into the pieces and I believe character animation is a great way to create a connection with an audience.</div>
