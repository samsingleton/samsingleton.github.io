<div class=description-titles>Overview</div>
<div class=description-body>
SleepCircle is a submission for the RSA Student Competition. It’s created for the Sleep Matters brief. It’s a service that contains all the information you would need to improve your sleep without any conflict or information that can negatively impact your sleep. Sleeping is something everybody has to do everyday, more than half of the population struggles with their sleep due to external factors like stress. Everyone in their life has had some sort of sleep issue and is something that may be unavoidable. Sleep is extremely important and lacking enough sleep for the day ahead can be detrimental to how you feel during the day. Lack of sleep can also cause major conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. There are conditions that can make sleep a struggle such as arthritis, asthma, depression, and back- pain. We spend approximately a third of our lives sleeping, it’s important we care for our sleepy selves.

<div class=description-titles>Brief</div>
<div class=description-body>
There are a number of products available which are marketed to help sleep however they usually target the symptoms of poor sleep rather than aid in improving sleep. With this brief we have been asked to think over this and push our ideas further to improve sleep rather than symptoms of lack of sleep. We have been asked to explore how sleep can be improved and the arguments between quality and quantity.

Rather than referencing the usual ‘8 hour sleep is optimal‘ guidelines, we’ve been asked to explore the factors that can cause our sleeping habits to diminish. Factors such as nutrition, exercise, mental states, physical environments and more. We have been asked to look at the existing products within our home which may be able to contribute to a better sleep.

<div class=description-titles>Process</div>
<div class=description-body>
For this project I wanted to look into how I could explore answering this brief in a more practical way. During researching this topic I found substantial amounts of conflicting information including some where doctors were even giving different information about the same subject. I wanted to create a safe-place for information where you can be assured that whatever you try can be beneficial to you. I created a promotional motion graphic piece for this which can be seen above. I wanted to be really personal with the promotional content as I wanted to create a connection between the audience and service. When starting the branding for this service I wanted to look into how language was used within health services and improve upon that. I created a guideline in which the tone of the narration had to follow, which I believe was one of the most important parts when creating the piece. I wanted to express the information in a calm, friendly tone, whilst also being informative. The aim of this service is to not nag you to change your life-style but inform or inspire a change.</div>
