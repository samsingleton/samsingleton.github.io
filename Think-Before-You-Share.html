<div class=description-body>
Our data is becoming more and more at risk, the general public doesn’t know where their data is going or what it’s used for. This motion piece explore the potential future of our data, and highlights the risks of oversharing online. It’s becoming more important to keep safe online and reflect on whether our internet activities could negatively impact us in the long run. I treated this project as more of a research piece where I was able to explore where our data goes, I then applied theoretical futures of what could happen to create a piece that could shock an audience. This piece was created for my typography unit during my third year of motion graphics.

<div class=description-titles>Brief</div>
<div class=description-body>
The brief for this project was extremely open allowing us to chose what we wanted to create. My original proposal for this brief was. The issue of cyber attacks is worldwide and can affect anyone with a computer, mobile phone, tablet or piece of technology with access to the internet. Because of this I believe it important to inform users prevention of cyber attacks. I feel this is a major issue that can effect anyone at any given moment, with risks of their personal data being sold or published anywhere. The issue of cyber security has been in the media recently however I believe the target audience I aim to create this piece for have not taken any action to prevent this problem effecting them. This is an exciting point of view for the project I am doing as it is in complete contrast with the advertising banks and other companies are currently putting out. This means I should be able to tap into a gap in the market that hasn’t been explored as of yet. The problem with the current advertising is that it’s being aimed at the older generation that are very wary of technology and believe that anything could cause harm to their personal computers. However the younger generation of people is where I aim express the urgency towards computer safety as I believe there is a lack of care being expressed when using the internet. They are too trustworthy of it. I ended up changing the target audience for this piece as I didn’t like the direction it was heading and wanted to create a more striking piece. I edited the target audience to 18-25 year olds.

<div class=description-titles>Process</div>
<div class=description-body>
I started this project with the intent of creating a cyber awareness piece meaning I ended up researching heavily into types of cyber attacks and how people can help themselves whilst using the internet. I believe that this was actually beneficial as it allowed me to look much further into the use of internet than what would have been otherwise. I believe that starting visual research at it’s most primitive forms is really important. Visually I started looking to different types of data like decimals, hexadecimal codes, octal, and binary. I began to start sketching using grids which inspired my visual language throughout the piece. And begun creating a narrative of a single person which ended up being named a singular data point throughout the piece. I wanted to start the piece somewhat small and then gradually increase the impact within to make it more striking to an audience.</div>
