<div class=description-body>
Our data is becoming more and more at risk, the general public doesn’t know where their data is going or what it’s used for. This motion piece explore the potential future of our data, and highlights the risks of oversharing online. It’s becoming more important to keep safe online and reflect on whether our internet activities could negatively impact us in the long run. I treated this project as more of a research piece where I was able to explore where our data goes, I then applied theoretical futures of what could happen to create a piece that could shock an audience. This piece was created for my typography unit during my third year of motion graphics.

<div class=description-titles>Brief</div>
<div class=description-body>
The brief for this project was to create a motion peiece with heavy use of typography. I chose to create a peice around the idea of data as the subject as it's becomming more relevent recently and I believe it's terrifying how far data collection has come. The outcome for this video was a short infographic that enables an audeince to get an understanding of where our abuse of freedom on the internet could take us in the future.

<div class=description-titles>Process</div>
<div class=description-body>
I started this project with the intent of creating a cyber awareness piece meaning I ended up researching heavily into types of cyber attacks and how people can help themselves whilst using the internet. I believe that this was actually beneficial as it allowed me to look much further into the use of internet than what would have been otherwise. I believe that starting visual research at it’s most primitive forms is really important. I started looking to different types of data like decimals, hexadecimal codes, octal, and binary. I began to start sketching using grids which inspired my visual language throughout the piece. And begun creating a narrative of a single person which ended up being named a singular data point throughout the piece. I wanted to start the piece somewhat small and then gradually increase the impact within to make it more striking to an audience.</div>
